          I'm a self-taught, full-stack developer from Texas. I've spent most of
          my life tinkering with things and trying to make things that are
          useful for myself and others.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          I'm passionate about explaining complex topics in simple and
          approachable ways and sharing the things I learn each day.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          I spend my free time starting more projects than I'll ever be able to
          finish and learning as much as I can along the way.
