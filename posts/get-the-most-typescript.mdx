If you're an uninitiated JavaScript developer, reading through an large Typescript codebase can be intimidating.

And unfortunately, this might scare many away from giving it a try.

The truth is that you can get a ton of benefit from using typescript without using complex types and using advanced features like generics and polymorphic types. 

Almost all of the popular NPM packages you either have types included or have community-created types that are going completely unused in a regular JS codebase. 

With that in mind, let's go through the "easy wins" you can use to get the most out of typescript.

To get the most out of Typescript, you'll more than likely have to use VS code, which has a ton of Typescript integrations built in (since they're both made by Microsoft).

The biggest thing to use is "intellisense". You probably already use it, but when you write a variable and type a dot, VS code will try to autocomplete with the known methods / properties for that variable.

This can help with built-in methods (like calling .replace on a string) but also help explore methods for external libraries. 

And if you need more information about a method, you can mouse over a method or variable to see the types and possibly the documentation for the method included by the library. If you're lucky, it might even include a link to a section of their documentation or an example.
