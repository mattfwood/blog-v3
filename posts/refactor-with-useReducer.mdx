I'll start with a disclaimer: I am not the biggest fan of Redux.

I think Redux has some great ideas, but it tends to overcomplicate things and create more problems than it solves.

It wasn't until I started using React's [`useReducer` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) that I started to appreciate what a reducer does.

As I started using it more, I even started to realize that I hadn't fully grasped what a "reducer" actually _was_.

> A reducer is basically a function that takes in a series of actions and an `initialState`, and then "reduces" them to get the current state of the application.

If this sounds familiar, it's because it's the same as the `.reduce` method for arrays:

```js title=src/components/post.jsx
const actions = [{
  type: 'SIGN_IN',
  payload: { name: 'Chidi' }
}, {
  type: 'SIGN_OUT'
}]

const initialState = {
  user: null,
}

const currentState = actions.reduce((state, action) => {
// to find the current state of our app
// we take our initialState and apply all the actions on top of it
  if (action.type === 'SIGN_IN') {
    state = { ...state, user: { name: action.payload } }
  }

  if (action.type === 'SIGN_OUT') {
    state = { ...state, user: null }
  }

  return state;
// this is how we define our initial state in `.reduce`
}, initialState);

// currentState would equal { user: null }
```

Here, `currentState` would return `{ user: null }`, because even though we signed in, the last action we took was signing out.

If you've used Redux or `useReducer` before, this will look similar even though there's no actual "reducer" in this code.

The reason this is helpful in React is because we frequently have lots of pieces of state we need to track, and they'll often change in groups.

So instead of using 4 or 5 `useState` calls, we can use a reducer to create _actions_ that describe our different state changes.

Let's start with this example of a login form:

```jsx react-live
const { useState } = React;
const LoginForm = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState(null);

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // before we send the request, change loading state
    setIsLoading(true);

    try {
      // send data to your "API"
      const response = await setTimeout(() => ({ data: 'success' }), 500)

      // if it's successful, set the data in state
      setData(response.data);
      alert('Success')
    } catch (error) {
      // if something goes wrong, they shouldn't get stuck in the loading state
      setErrorMessage(error.message);
    }

    setIsLoading(false);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* we're using a fieldset here to disable all fields while the form is loading
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset
      */}
      <fieldset disabled={isLoading}>
        <label>
          Email
          <input
            value={email}
            onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          />
        </label>
        <label>
          Password
          <input
            type="password"
            value={password}
            onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)}
          />
        </label>
        {errorMessage !== null && <div>{errorMessage}</div>}
        <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
  )
}

render(<LoginForm />)
```

This is a fairly standard component pattern for something like a login form. It includes:
- Tracking input values and storing them in state
- A loading state boolean to disable parts of the UI
- Error handling and error message feedback

In its current form it works fine, but if we added one or two more fields (maybe something like a "Stay Logged In" checkbox), it could start to become hard to manage.

Instead, we could try to rethink our component's state changes in terms of "actions".

When we make a request, we could call the action something like `START_SIGN_IN`, and it would change our `isLoading` field to `true`.

When we get data back, we could make an action called `SIGN_IN_SUCCESS`, which would set the `isLoading` field to `false` and set our `data` with our request response.

Let's start by converting these "actions" into a reducer:

```js
// a reducer takes the current state and the next action as params
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    // we'll use this to handle our input field changes
    case 'HANDLE_CHANGE':
      // this syntax allows us to dynamically declare the key on an object
      // so for our "email" input, this would be { email: "chidi@gmail.com" }
      return { ...state, [action.name]: action.payload };
    // this is how we start our loading step
    case 'START_SIGN_IN':
      return { ...state, isLoading: true };
    case 'SIGN_IN_SUCCESS':
      return { ...state, isLoading: false, data: action.payload };
    case 'SET_ERROR_MESSAGE':
      return { ...state, isLoading: false, errorMessage: action.payload };
    // we use this default to make sure any typos don't fail silently
    default:
      throw new Error(`Action ${action.type} not found`);
  }
}
```

Now, we can take this reducer and pass it to the React `useReducer` hook like this:

```jsx
// for our initial state, we'll use all the initial states above in our `useState()` calls
const initialState = {
  email: '',
  password: '',
  isLoading: false,
  data: null,
  errorMessage: null,
}

const LoginForm = () => {
  // we'll use our `reducer` from above
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  // ...rest of the component
}
```

Now we have a `state` object and a `dispatch` function that we can use to call our actions. So if we wanted to handle a successful sign in, we would call:

```js
dispatch({ type: 'SIGN_IN_SUCCESS', payload: data})
```

This is telling our reducer that the action we want to use is called `SIGN_IN_SUCCESS`, and the `payload` is any additional data we need to pass to our action. In this case, it's the response we're getting from the API.

Now we can change all of our `setState` calls to `dispatch` calls, and you'll see how it becomes easier to understand what's happening at each step in your app.

For example, in the `handleSubmit` function, you can read the actions like instructions. First you "start sign in", and if it's successful you dispatch `SIGN_IN_SUCCESS`. If something goes wrong, you set an error message.

This is not only easier for you to read, but it's _much_ easier for your coworkers to read as well. It also forces you to think about your state not as an object that's being changed, but as a "state machine" that's changed by actions.

Here's what your final result might look like:

```jsx
const LoginForm = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  const { email, password, isLoading, errorMessage } = state;

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // before we send the request, change loading state
    dispatch({ type: 'START_SIGN_IN' });

    try {
      // send data to your API
      const response = await api.post('/login', { email, password })

      // if it's successful, toggle the loading boolean and set the data in state
      dispatch({ type: 'SIGN_IN_SUCCESS', payload: response.data });
    } catch (error) {
      // if something goes wrong, they shouldn't get stuck in the loading state
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_ERROR', payload: error.message });
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <fieldset disabled={isLoading}>
        <label>
          Email
          <input
            value={email}
            onChange={e =>
              dispatch({
                type: 'HANDLE_CHANGE',
                name: 'email',
                payload: e.target.value,
              })
            }
          />
        </label>
        <label>
          Password
          <input
            type="password"
            value={password}
            onChange={e =>
              dispatch({
                type: 'HANDLE_CHANGE',
                name: 'password',
                payload: e.target.value,
              })
            }
          >
        </label>
        {errorMessage !== null && <div>{errorMessage}</div>}
        <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
  );
};
```

If you want to push this even further, you could even turn this reducer into a custom hook called something like `useRequest` and use it throughout your app.
