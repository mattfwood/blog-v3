As you start writing more in React, it's easy to lose sight of how to do things "outside" of React.

For example, if you had a React modal prompting the user to log in, but you wanted to be able to "trigger" that modal from some separate Javascript (maybe from a script tag added by an outside source), how would you do that?

You might get caught up in a React-sounding solution:

```jsx
function App() {
  function openModal() {
    // ...other code to open modal
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    // whenever openModal changes, you can bind it to the window?
    window.openModal = openModal;
  }, [openModal])

  // ... rest of the component
}
```

And while this might work in some simpler cases, we're putting a function in the global scope and it's likely that we'll run into bugs if certain things change.

Instead, we should reach for a Javascript feature designed for situations like this: [Custom Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events).

When breaking down this problem, there are two main parts:
- We want our app to "listen" and respond to an outside event
- Code outside our app must be able to "trigger" this listener

If this sounds familiar, it's because we use the same [Observer Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) for HTML elements:

```html
<body>
  <button>Alert!</button>
  <script>
    const button = document.querySelector('#button');

    // we add our listener here, and the "click" event is our trigger
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      // when the even is triggered, we run this code
      alert('Button Clicked!');
    });
  </script>
</body>
```
