Typescript, for all its benefits, isn't the best at making its utilities well known.

One Typescript trick I wish I'd known about much sooner is ["`const` assertions".](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions)

Const assertions, as the name implies, are a way to "lock in" the type of an object that you don't expect to change.

By default, if you create an object, Typescript will give fairly loose type definitions for each value:

<Image alt="typescript metadata example" src="/images/typescript-const-example-1.png" height={165} width={305} />

However, if you know that these values won't change, it can be more helpful to use `const` to lock in the type.

<Image alt="typescript metadata example" src="/images/typescript-const-example-2.png" height={168} width={436} />

This does a few things:

1. It makes all of the properties `readonly`, so that they can't accidentally be changed.
2. It prevents you from doing checks that would be impossible

```typescript
const metadata = {
    title: "Matt's Blog",
    description: 'This is a blog, I guess'
} as const;

// the following line will return:
/*
This condition will always return 'false'
since the types '"Matt's Blog"' and '"Some other title"'
have no overlap.(2367)
*/
if (metadata.title === 'Some other title') {
    alert('This should not be possible');
}
```
