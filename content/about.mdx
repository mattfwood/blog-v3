My name's Matt Wood.

I'm a self-taught, full-stack developer from Texas. I've spent most of my life tinkering with things and trying to make things that are useful for myself and others.

I'm passionate about explaining complex topics in simple and approachable ways and sharing the things I learn each day.

I spend my free time starting more projects than I'll ever be able to finish and learning as much as I can along the way.
